Such disputes are called \"Claims\" for purposes of this agreement. This binding agreement to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the dispute is between you and us jointly or separately. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator acting under the administration of United States Arbitration and Mediation, MidWest, Inc., and in accordance with the then-applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, or unless the arbitration administrator's rules or law require otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in Minneapolis, MN.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #40434b;\"><span style=\"font-family: proxima-nova, Avenir, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The arbitrator will decide the Claim in accordance with all applicable law, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all privileges recognized by law.

In the event that there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings, or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator; and to the extent it is determined that resolution of a Claim must proceed on a class basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in arbitration. If you elect to proceed with respect any Claim by an individual action in a small claims court, or its equivalent, instead of arbitration, we will not object, however, any such action shall be taken in small claims court in Texas or Deleware.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #40434b;\"><span style=\"font-family: proxima-nova, Avenir, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court.

Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur.

In addition, the right to discovery and the right to appeal may also be limited or eliminated in arbitration.
